# Get Kraken Calendar

## Add all Seattle Kraken home games to your google calendar

Currently the official way to add Kraken games to your Google Calendar requires you to give some random app extensive access to your google calendar.

With Get Kraken Calendar, you download a simple .csv file, the file data is parsed and formatted for Google Calendar, and you are given a new .csv file that can be easily imported into Google Calendar.

## Installation & Use

Once the program is installed locally, just open the index.html file.

This should open up the program in your web browser of choice.

Download the file "Download fixture as a CSV" for the Seattle Kraken from the listed site, https://fixturedownload.com/sport/ice-hockey

Locate the file with the file picker in the app

Click the "Format for Google Calendar" button to download the formatted .csv file.

## Add to Google Calendar

Open up Google Calendar

Click on the gear icon in the upper right, and click on the "settings" tab

Once on the settings page, click the "Import & Export" tab on the left

Use the "Select file from your computer" input to select the file you just created

Select the calendar you want to add the events to. I recommend adding a new calendar to contain all the events so you can select and change them independently

Click the "Import" button. All the home games should be added to your calendar

## Extending Functionality

Currently formats data for Pacific Time Zone. Some code would need to be changed for any other zones.

Currently only adds Kraken home games. Can be easily changed to add away games, or work with other teams. This functinoality may be added in the future.

Code currently needs to be updated on a season by season basis to update daylight savings time days
